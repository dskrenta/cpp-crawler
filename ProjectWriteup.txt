Project Description:

Multithreaded web crawler written in C++ with page ranking abilities designed for use in a search architecture.

Depending on how far I get during the week I may add recrawl policies and a sample full text search class to demonstate the crawler in action.

Project Goals:

  Personal:
    - Implement a working web crawler in C++
    - Store data for eventual searching
    - Learn about web search technology through simplistic practice

  General:
    - Fast web crawling through a thread pool architecture
    - Configurable to allow for different crawling scenarios (host whitelist, host blacklist)
    - Page rank abilities through the use of a directed graph
    - Save downloaded HTML content for later processing

Class Descriptions:

Crawler - Main class for project
WebGraph - Class to represent graph structure of crawled websites
Url - Class to wrap the url string, provides some helper methods, node for WebGraph
ThreadPool - Class for managing the thread pool used for multithreaded crawling
Worker - Worker class for ThreadPool
